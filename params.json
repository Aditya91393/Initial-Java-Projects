I’m a grade 11 student with a passion for helping others and making the lives of the people around me easier. \r\n\r\n# _**About me**_\r\nEver since I was a child, I’ve had the dream to make the world a better place with ingeniously & innovatively crafted technology. So, I started began my ascent into the world of technology, from watching science videos to participating in science fairs to visiting companies with state of the art technology. Ever since grade 7, I’ve been innovating and creating projects & technology that would revolutionize the world as we know it. Though it may seem far fetched, the projects I’ve created are 100% professional. I’ve conducted research, created a product using CAD and even 3-D printed prototypes.\r\n\r\n# _**Past Projects**_\r\n\r\n*\tA novel treatment for Carpel Tunnel Syndrome\r\n*\tA green & affordable house \r\n*\tA 100% green water filtration plant\r\n*\tA affordable lake cleanser\r\n*\tA animal shelter\r\n*\tAn energy producing bridge\r\n*\tAn insulated flask\r\n\r\n# _**My Best Innovation**_\r\n\r\n**ATLAS** \r\nATLAS is an innovative and ingenious invention, engineered to treat Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, a disorder in the musculoskeletal and nervous system. It’s audience is for those who can’t afford the luxury of surgery or months of medication. This is an effective and efficient way to treat Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.\r\n  \r\nIt was created and designed using a CAD software and has been 3-D printed. I’m currently in the process of getting a patent for this design & innovation. \r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdityaSharma6/Beginner-Java-Assignments/master/ATLAS%201.jpg)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdityaSharma6/Beginner-Java-Assignments/master/ATLAS%202.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n# _**Programming Experience**_\r\nThough I’ve just recently began coding, I’m already fluent in Arduino and I’m in the process of learning Java and Java Script. \r\n\r\nRegarding Arduino, I created a BOE bot which is programmed to follow light & work on any race tracks. \r\n\r\nRegarding Java and Java Script, I’ve been creating program codes to solve simple tasks like calculating the area of any shape, calculating the average of your marks etc...\r\n\r\n# _**Contact**_\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact me at my email which is \"adityanirmalsharma@hotmail.com\" If you have any questions related to my code, please visit my github \"https://github.com/AdityaSharma6\"\r\n\r\n",
